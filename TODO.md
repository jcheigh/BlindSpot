## üöÄ Features

### Backend 
- [x] Setup simple working API (done 6/8 10:00)
  - [x] Change Goodfire SDK to async
- [x] Refactor backend to be not crap (done 6/8 11:00)
  - [x] Add logging with colorama 
  - [x] Update env/make things configurable 
- [x] Add difficulties (done 6/8 11:30)
- [ ] Figure out algorithmic to do 
  - [ ] Add session history in conversations (langchain or native in assistant-ui)

**Algorithmic To Do**
This is just my thoughts at this point. Roughly, here are some things that are really bad:
1. Distance: we need something like check cosine similarity + have a threshold on that 
2. Classification:
    - Our Goodfire classifier should be improved. One we need to extract feature values, not just abort_when. Two, per task we may want to experiment and see stuff like what features is it actually looking at, how do those feature values change across different conversations (both false positives/true negatives)
    - FewShot Classifier that just uses 4o-mini or something, data generated by LLM, ideally we could get log probs I'd need to check if this is allowed 
    - EnsembleClassifier- take Goodfire/FewShot and ensemble them to perform good classification. Figure out good ways to evaluate this. 
3. Concepts: this is not a well defined term yet. 
### Frontend 
- [ ] Figure out basic design
- Stack: next.js, react, typescript, tailwind, assistant-ui (for chat UI)

### Other
- [ ] Deployment 
- [ ] Cleanup/refactoring/error handling
- [ ] Update README.md
